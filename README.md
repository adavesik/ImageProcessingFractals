# Image Processing and Fractal Generation

This C project provides a set of image processing operations that manipulate the size, filter, brightness, contrast, saturation, and other properties of PPM images. Additionally, it includes functions to generate popular fractals, including the Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Koch curve, Barnsley fern, and Sierpinski triangle.

## Features

- Read and write PPM images.
- Resize images.
- Apply filters and adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation.
- Generate fractals: Mandelbrot set, Julia set, Koch curve, Barnsley fern, Sierpinski triangle.

## Usage

1. Include the necessary header files in your project.
2. Utilize the provided functions for image processing and fractal generation.
3. Compile the project using Microsoft Visual Studio on Windows 10 or 11.
